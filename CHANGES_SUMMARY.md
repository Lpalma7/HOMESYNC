# Summary of Changes Made to Fix the Home Automation App

## 1. Database Path Corrections

The main issue was that the app was trying to access data in a nested path under `users/{userId}/appliances`, but the Firebase database structure shows appliances as a top-level collection. We've updated all Firestore paths to access the correct collections:

- Changed from `users/{userId}/appliances` to `appliances`
- Updated all database access methods to use the correct paths

## 2. Firebase Security Rules

Created new Firebase security rules to allow access to the necessary collections:
- Added rules for `appliances` collection
- Added rules for `relay_states` collection
- Added rules for `electricity_usage` collection
- Maintained secure access for user-specific data

## 3. Master Switch Functionality (relay10)

Fixed the master switch functionality:
- Ensured relay10 properly controls all devices
- Prevented individual switches from being toggled when master switch is OFF
- Updated relay state handling to properly sync with Firestore

## 4. Room and Device Display

Improved room and device display:
- Fixed room display to show all rooms from the top-level collection
- Added fallback to hardcoded rooms when no rooms are found in Firestore
- Improved device filtering to show devices for each room correctly

## 5. ESP32 Integration

Enhanced ESP32 code to track electricity usage:
- Implemented presentHourlyusage calculation when relays are ON
- Added functionality to pause usage counting when relays are OFF
- Updated the code to store usage data in the correct Firebase paths

## 6. Debugging Improvements

Added debugging logs throughout the app:
- Added logs for device discovery
- Added logs for relay state changes
- Added logs for device toggling operations

## Files Modified

1. `rooms.dart` - Updated to access top-level collections and fixed room display
2. `roomsinfo.dart` - Fixed device display and relay state handling
3. `devices_screen.dart` - Updated to access top-level collections and fixed master switch functionality
4. `databaseservice.dart` - Updated database access methods
5. `home_automationv2.ino` - Enhanced ESP32 code for electricity usage tracking

## Next Steps

1. Update the Firebase security rules using the provided instructions
2. Restart the app to verify that the permission error is resolved
3. Test the master switch functionality to ensure it properly controls all devices
4. Verify that individual devices can be toggled when the master switch is ON
5. Monitor the electricity usage tracking to ensure it's working correctly
